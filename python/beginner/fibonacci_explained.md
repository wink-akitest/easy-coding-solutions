# Fibonacci Sequence (Beginner)

## Problem
Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

## Example Input : n = 5
## Example Output : [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

## Explanation
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms:
- Term 1: 0
- Term 2: 1
- Term 3: 0 + 1 = 1
- Term 4: 1 + 1 = 2
- Term 5: 1 + 2 = 3
